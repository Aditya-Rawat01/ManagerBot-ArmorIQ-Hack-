# ArmorIQ experiment log

Procedures: `ProxyLead_Day1_Experiments.md` and PRD v2 §11.
Rule: an experiment passes only with evidence from the real ArmorIQ
organization and the deployed HTTPS MCP endpoint. Mocks never pass a gate.

## Status

| ID | Legacy ID | Question | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | E1 | Planned SDK call reaches the MCP server through ArmorIQ; credential path | **NOT RUN** | — |
| E2 | E2 | Off-plan attempt: SDK-side vs hosted-proxy enforcement; underscore-field tampering | **NOT RUN** | — |
| E3 | E5 + E4b | Same tool, different members → ALLOW / HOLD / BLOCK | **NOT RUN** | — |
| E4 | E6 + E7 + E11 | HOLD → console approval/rejection → SDK resume; expiry | **NOT RUN** | — |
| E5 | E12 + E14 | Agent/MCP/tool names, member resolution, policy schema | **NOT RUN** | — |
| E17 | — | Grounding: threshold, citations, abstention | **NOT RUN** | — |

As of the foundation bootstrap (2026-10-14) no ArmorIQ organization, API key,
or deployed MCP endpoint has been used from this repository.

## Setup record (P1-01, Wave 1)

- Run at (UTC): 2026-10-14 ~18:00 (org created, members active, agent registered this session)
- Organization: `ArmorIQ-hackathon`, created Oct 2026, active. Sidebar inventory: 1 agent, 0 MCP servers, 1 policy (starter, see below).
- Quotas: not surfaced anywhere in the console UI (checked Dashboard, Team, Settings). Current usage: 3 members, 1 agent, 1 policy, 0 MCP servers. Expected per Arch §5.1 (2 endpoints, 2 policies, 5 members) — unverified until quotas are visible or E5.
- Members (all Active, Pending 0; full emails never recorded — masked below):

  | Persona | Member (masked) | Console role | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Maya (manager) | `a***@g***.com` (`Aditya-Rawat01`, project owner) | Org Admin | Active |
  | Sam (senior) | `s***@g***.com` (`samarth-chawla`) | Analyst | Active |
  | Priya (junior) | `p***@g***.com` (`parthgoyal26-03-2005`) | Analyst | Active |

  Persona-to-account mapping decided by the team on 15 Oct 2026 (D-25):
  Sam = `samarth-chawla`, Priya = `parthgoyal26-03-2005`. The matching
  `PERSONA_SAM_EMAIL` / `PERSONA_PRIYA_EMAIL` values are set privately (never here).
  Hard facts for the gates: Maya is Org Admin and outranks both Analyst accounts (Arch §5.6.8: approver outranks requester, no self-approval).
- Agent: `proxylead` (exact FIXED name), ID `eae6515b-4095-458d-98f0-03310cf4e3cb`, type Assistant, owner Maya account, environment Development.
  Registry status: **pending** (registered, unscanned — the scan needs a reachable URL, which lands with the P1-05 deploy + P1-06 endpoint attach; rescan then).
  Registered with placeholder URL `https://proxylead-not-yet-deployed.invalid`
  (RFC-2606 `.invalid`, never resolves) and placeholder API-key auth. Real Render URL
  + real bearer land in P1-06; the console audit note + URL must then be updated (tracked in P5-03).
- API key: type **live**, stored only in local `.env` (`ARMORIQ_API_KEY`) and later the
  Render secret store. Value and full emails never enter the repository (secret scan below).
- Policy: one starter policy was attached by the registration flow. It is NOT the
  authored policy — P1-08 replaces it (G2 needs the authored, accepted policy). No certificate issued (org has no CA; nothing to fix).
- Console quirk (for teammates): the Custom (manual) wizard renders no URL field but
  the backend rejects an empty `url` (400). `POST /agent/register` on `api.armoriq.ai`
  is dashboard-JWT-only (service API keys get 401). Working path: **Connect by URL**
  with the placeholder — console accepts "endpoint unreachable, will register without scan".
- Pending-delegation location in the console: not identified during setup (unverified). Input for E4/D-22 still open; P1-10 locates it.
- Outcome: setup complete (persona mapping decided 15 Oct 2026). Console facts
  above are the account holder's observations; quotas could not be observed.
  No MCP endpoints registered yet (needs the P1-05 public URL; happens in P1-06).
